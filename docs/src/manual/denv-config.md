# DESCRIPTION

Manipulate the configuration of a denv that already exists.
The commands here will all fail if a denv hasn't been created,
see **denv-init(1)** to create a new denv.

**`denv config`** is separated into a set of sub-commands that
are focused on manipulating the different aspects of the denv
configuration. These correspond to the different keywords specified
after 'config'.

## COMMANDS

**help** print a help message for **`denv config`**. This is the command that is issued
         if no keywords are given. It also has the aliases **`-h`** and **`--help`**.

**print** print the loaded denv configuration. This is helpful for debugging purposes and
          inspecting the denv that you currently have configured.

**image** set (and potentially pull) the container image that should be used with the denv
          that you currently reside in.

**mounts** provide additional directories to mount into the denv during running.

**shell** set the shell that should be executed by denv if no other command is given by the user.

**env** manipulate and view the environment variables that will be provided to the denv at run time.

# ARGUMENTS

Below are different arguments that can be provided separated by which command they correspond to.

## print

**env** If any argument is provided to print, then all of the environment variables that will be passed into
        the denv are printed after the deduced configuration. Without an argument, print will just show the
        deduced configuration and only print the environment variables if copy-all is false.

## image

**IMAGE** The provided argument is the image tag that should be used for running with the denv. If this argument
          is the special key-word 'pull', then it won't change the actual image tag and instead re-download the
          currently configured image from the registry.

For apptainer and singularity runners, this IMAGE can also be a filesystem path to a unpacked image that is
already downloaded (and unpacked) somewhere else on the computer. In this case, we simply symlink the image
to our image cache so denv can operate like normal. Work is on-going to investigate supporting this workflow
for other container runners <https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/denv/issues/37>.

## mounts

**DIR** Each of the space-separate arguments are interpreted as a directory that should be included in the list
        of mounts for the container that denv spawns. These are in addition to the mount of the denv workspace
        to the container home directory. They are mounted into the container at the same filesystem location that
        they have on the host. These directories are required to be full paths so that the user is cognizant 
        of what paths will be available in the container and what arent.
        One can use **realpath(1)** to deduce a fullpath from a relative path in a POSIX-compliant way if desired.

## shell

**`SHELL`** the program to use as the interactive shell within the containerized environment.
            No checks on what this program is or if it is even available within the container are done.
            As the name implies, **`denv`** expects it to be some shell that the user can interact with
            but technically it is just the default program that is run when the user does not provide
            any arguments to **`denv`**.

## env

The **`env`** subcommand has its own sub-commands due to the variability of defining which environment
variables should be copied into the containerized environment.

**help** print a help message for this subcommand. This has aliases **`-h`** and **`--help`** as well.

**print** print out the environment variables and their values that will be passed into the container.

**all** toggle the decision on if all possible environment variables from the host environment should be copied.
        **`yes`**, **`true`**, **`on`** all mean to copy all possible variables from the host environment, while
        their inverses **`no`**, **`false`**, **`off`** mean to disable this feature and only copy variables that
        are explicitly defined via the **`copy`** command below. Variables defined with a specific value overwrite
        any values that would be copied from the environment.

**copy** configure which environment variables to copy into the denv at runtime. Each of the space-separated
        arguments to this command are treated separated and are interpreted as a **VAR** with an optional **VAL**
        distinguished by a '=' character.

- **`VAR`** environment variable name either in the host environment that should be copied into the denv
        (if no value is specified with an '=' sign) or defined to a specific value (when a value
        is specified with an '=' sign). These names cannot match special shell environment
        names (e.g. 'HOME') or special denv names (e.g. 'DENV_RUNNER').

- **`VAL`** environment variable value to use instead of the value from the host environment.
        These values cannot have the special characters:
        space \' \', tick \'`\', quote \'"\', or dollar-sign \'$\'.
        Providing a value for a specific environment variable means that variable does not need
        to exist in the host environment. Moreover, providing a value takes precedence: if a value
        is provided, the denv will receive that value, ignoring any value that may exist in the environment
        (even if **all** is toggled to on and all environment variables are being copied).

# EXAMPLES

Print out the current configuration of the denv.

    denv config print

Change the image that the denv should use when running. *Be careful.* No cleaning or checking of compatibility
is done. A drastic enough change in the image may require recompilations or even re-writes of code being written
and developed within the denv.

    denv config image my-repo/my-image:new-tag

Pull down the image that is currenlty configured again. This is helpful if the denv is using an image tag like
"latest" and should be updated to the latest release again. Updating to the latest release is *not* done
automatically because of the warnings above.

    denv config image pull

## Sharing Environment Variables

The syntax for sharing environment variables with the denv is a bit terse, so it is helpful
to display some examples.

By default (without **`--no-copy-all`** or **`--clean-env`** when running **`denv init`**), **`denv`** will copy all
possible environment variables from the host into the denv. This means one can

    export foo=bar
    printenv foo      # prints out "bar"
    denv printenv foo # also prints "bar"

In some situations, this is over-sharing and you can disable this so that host environment
variables are not copied into the denv anymore.

    denv config env all no
    export foo=bar
    printenv foo      # prints out "bar"
    denv printenv foo # does not print anything and returns the error code 1

Even with copying all environment variables disabled, one can still copy specific values
from the host or set specific variables to have specific values for the denv.

    denv config env copy baz myfoo=mybaz
    denv printenv myfoo # prints "mybaz"
    printenv myfoo      # does not print anything and returns error code 1
    denv printenv baz   # not set in host yet so does not print anything
    export baz="hooray"
    denv printenv baz   # prints "hooray"

# FILES

The **`denv config`** command is used to safely edit the `.denv/config` file so that the user does
not accidentally break their configuration. Nevertheless, this file is a regular text file and so
can be edited directly if the user wishes to do something more advanced that the basic commands
described above can handle.

The config file is a basic key=value shell file that will be sourced by **`denv`** whenever the configuration
is needed. **`denv`** assumes that this config file defines the following shell variables for it to use.

  **denv_name** the name for this denv

  **denv_image** the image to use when running the denv

  **denv_shell** the program to run as a interactive shell if running denv without any arguments

  **denv_mounts** a space separated list of extra mounts to mount into denv when running

  **denv_env_var_copy_all** a boolean flag signalling if **`denv`** should copy all possible host environment
    variables into the denv (`"true"`) or not (`"false"`).

  **denv_env_var_copy** a space-separated list of host environment variables to copy into the denv.
    This is ignored if **denv_env_var_copy_all** is `"true"`. There are some restrictions on the names
    of variables that can be used and so editing this value directly is not recomended. Use **`denv config env copy`**
    which does this validation.

  **denv_env_var_set** a space-separate list of key=value pairs that will be set as environment variables
    within the denv. These values override any values that could be copied from the host. There are restrictions
    on the names and values that can be kept here so editing this value directly is not recommended.
    Use **`denv config env copy`** to edit this value while validating that the rules are followed.
