# Command Reference Manual

This section of the websites contains the HTML-rendered copies of the manpages
for `denv` and its major sub-commands.
Since these pages are mainly focused on being render-able by the `man` program,
their appearance on this site is slightly odd.
That being said, they are still a nice reference for anyone who prefers to
view the website rather than use `man denv` on the command line.
